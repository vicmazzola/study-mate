## 🔨 Project Features
- **Vite** for fast project setup and efficient development.
- **TypeScript** for type safety, maintainability, and better developer experience.
- **SCSS Modules** for modular and conflict-free styling.
- **Functional Components and Hooks**, leveraging:
  - `useState` for state management.
  - `useEffect` for handling side effects.
- **Clean Code Practices**:
  - **Componentization**: Breaking UI into reusable, independent components.
  - **Props and State Management** for dynamic rendering.
  - **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** and **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)** methodologies.

## 🕒 Watch & Stopwatch Functionality
This project implements a functional and interactive **stopwatch and watch system**, designed for responsiveness and ease of use.

### 🚀 Features:
- **Responsive Stopwatch**:
  - Start, stop, and reset functionality.
  - Styled using `Stopwatch.module.scss` for a scalable and consistent design.
- **Dynamic Watch**:
  - Displays the current time in an appealing format.
  - Styled using `Watch.module.scss` for modern aesthetics.
- **SCSS Modules**:
  - Independent component styling to avoid conflicts.
  - Responsive design optimized for different screen sizes.

## 🧑‍💻 Course Content
This project implements the following key concepts from the course:
- Setting up a React project with **TypeScript** from scratch using Vite.
- Understanding **Componentization, Props, and State** in React.
- Learning **CSS Modules** to prevent style conflicts.
- Exploring **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`) and how they replaced class components.
- Writing **clean and documented React code** following modern best practices.

## ✔️ Technologies Used
